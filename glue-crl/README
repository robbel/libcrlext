Make a crl agent available in rl-glue. Agents that implement the glue_agent.hpp
interface are automatically available in rl-glue. Similarly for glue_env.hpp.

Note: by default, these agents are not networked (merely implement Agent_common 
interface).

Note: both example programs, random_agent and walk_env, are additionally 
a networked program through usage of the rlgnm library.

Note: a cpp library and example programs.
