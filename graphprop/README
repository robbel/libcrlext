A specific domain (disease propagation over a graph), utilizing the glue-crl 
interface (and therefore available in rl-glue). Additionally networked
through usage of the rlgnm library.

Note: also includes a graph generator (GraphGen.py) that utilizes the 
python-igraph library.

Note: graphprop problems contain a graph specification (see `data') and a model 
configuration (see `cfgs').
