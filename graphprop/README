A specific domain (disease propagation over a graph), utilizing the glue-crl 
interface (and therefore available in rl-glue). Additionally networked
through usage of the rlgnm library.

Note: also includes multiple graph generators (GraphGen.py, randomGraph.py, 
buildFG.m) and visualization scripts (gvizz.py, gtopdf.py).

Note: graphprop problems contain a graph specification (see `data') and a model 
configuration (see `cfgs').
