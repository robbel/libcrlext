Fork from rl-glue experimentor, from https://code.google.com/p/experimentor/.

Note: required for experiment scripts in ./experiments

Note: this is compiled against librlgluenetdev (along with `exp_codec.c') to work over the network. As usual, an alternative is to choose librlglue and compile Agent and Environment into same executable.

See ./doc/experimentor.html for instructions.
Basic usage: 
  experimentor <experiments/my_experiment.py>
  experimentor_plot <exp_log/my_experiment/resultsXYZ.csv> where XYZ is the type of plot to generate
