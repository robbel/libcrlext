Fork from rl-glue experimentor, from https://code.google.com/p/experimentor/.

Note: required for experiment scripts in ./experiments

Note: this is compiled against librlgluenetdev (along with `exp_codec.c') to work over the network. As usual, an alternative is to choose librlglue and compile Agent and Environment into same executable.
